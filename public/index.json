If you are on Windows or Linux, please consult the guides on how to install Hugo, and GitHub’s CLI for your OS.\nAnyway, if you are using MacOS let’s install brew - a package manager for mac - as that will help installing and managing the other tools.\n/bin/bash -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\u0026#34; Once brew is installed let’s install Git, Hugo and GitHub’s CLI.\nbrew install git brew install hugo brew install gh Create a folder for your code and open a terminal session into it (I chose blowfish-tutorial in the commands below, feel free to call the folder whatever you want).\nmkdir blowfish-tutorial cd blowfish-tutorial Once inside the folder, the next step is to initialize your local git repo.\ngit init -b main Now, let’s create and sync the local repo to a GitHub repo so that your code is stored remotely.\ngh auth login gh repo create git push --set-upstream origin main Check the image below for the options I selected for this guide, again feel free to change names and description to your use-case.\nFinally, create a .gitignore file which allows you to exclude certain files from your repo automatically. I would start with something like the example below.\n#others node_modules .hugo_build.lock # OS generated files .DS_Store .DS_Store? ._* .Spotlight-V100 .Trashes # Hugo public The last step is to save all the changes to the repo.\ngit add . git commit -m “initial commit” git push Create site and configure it #\rWith all the tools ready, creating and configuring your site will be easy. Still within the folder you created in the last section, let’s create an empty Hugo website (with no theme).\nhugo new site --force . Once the scaffolding finishes, try the command below to run your page. Open a browser on https://localhost:1313 to see your site…\nhugo server Ups… Page not found – right? This was expected, even though you created a website, Hugo doesn’t give any default experience – aka your site doesn’t have any page to show.\nNext step, let\u0026rsquo;s install Blowfish using git submodules which will make it easier to manage and upgrade to new versions in the future.\ngit submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish Next, create the following folder structure at the root of your code directory - config/_default/. Now you will need to download these files and place them in _default folder you just created. The final structure should look something like this.\nconfig/_default/ ├─ config.toml ├─ languages.en.toml ├─ markup.toml ├─ menus.en.toml └─ params.toml ` Open the config.toml and uncomment the line theme = \u0026ldquo;blowfish” and you are ready to go. Try the running the site again and check the result at https://localhost:1313\nhugo server You should see something like the image below. Not much yet as we didn’t add any content, but the main skeleton for Blowfish is already in place - just requires configuration.\nNow let’s configure the theme.\nFYI This guide will not cover in detail what each parameter available in Blowfish does – for everything available and how to use it, check Blowfish documentation for every option in every file.\rmenus.en.toml #\rThis file defines your menu structure, for the top banner and the footer. For this guide, let’s create two menu sections: one for Posts and one for Tags.\nPosts - will display the full list of entries Tags - automatically generated based on tags placed on each article To achieve this, make sure the following entries exist in the menus.en.toml file. Once the changes are done, you should see the menus appearing by re-running hugo server.\n[[main]] name = \u0026#34;Posts\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;posts\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;Tags\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; weight = 30 languages.en.toml #\rThis file will configure your main details as the author of the website. Change the section below to reflect your details.\n[author] name = \u0026#34;Your name here\u0026#34; image = \u0026#34;profile.jpg\u0026#34; headline = \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m only human\u0026#34; bio = \u0026#34;A little bit about you\u0026#34; # appears in author card for each article The images for the website should be placed in the assets folder. For this step, please add a profile picture to that folder named profile.jpg or change the configuration above to the filename you chose. If you don’t have a profile image available, you can use the one below for the tutorial.\nassets/profile.jpg\rThe last step is configuring your links – social media, GitHub, etc. The file includes all the supported options, but they are commented. You are welcome to uncomment everything and delete the ones you would rather not use. Replace the right links on the ones you decided to keep. You can also change the order.\nparams.toml #\rThis is the main configuration file for Blowfish. Most of the visual options or customization available can be configured using it, and it covers several areas of the theme. For this tutorial, I decided to use a background layout - check other layouts for Blowfish’s landing page - with the Neon color scheme - you can pick a different color scheme if you want to - check this list or create your own.\nAdd an image.jpg to the assets folder which will be the background for the site. You can also download the examples I am using in this tutorial.\nassets/image.jpg\rNow let’s jump into the params.toml and start configuring the file. I will focus only on the values that need to be changed, don’t delete the rest of the file without reading the docs. Let’s begin by making sure that we have the right color scheme, that image optimization is on, and configure the default background image.\ncolorScheme = \u0026#34;neon\u0026#34; disableImageOptimization = false defaultBackgroundImage = \u0026#34;image.jpg\u0026#34; # used as default for background images Next, let\u0026rsquo;s configure our homepage. We’re going with the background layout, configuring the homepage image and recent items. Furthermore, we are using the card view for items in the recent category. Finally, let’s configure the header to be fixed.\n[homepage] layout = \u0026#34;background\u0026#34; # valid options: page, profile, hero, card, background, custom homepageImage = \u0026#34;image.jpg\u0026#34; # used in: hero, and card showRecent = true showRecentItems = 6 showMoreLink = true showMoreLinkDest = \u0026#34;/posts\u0026#34; cardView = true cardViewScreenWidth = false layoutBackgroundBlur = true # only used when layout equals background [header] layout = \u0026#34;fixed\u0026#34; Now configure how the article and list pages will look. Here are the configurations for those.\n[article] showHero = true heroStyle = \u0026#34;background\u0026#34; showSummary = true showTableOfContents = true showRelatedContent = true relatedContentLimit = 3 [list] showCards = true groupByYear = false cardView = true If you run hugo server again, you should see something like the image below.\nAdding content to your site #\rCreate a folder to place your posts in /content/posts. This was also the directory configured in your menu to list all the articles. Within that folder, let’s create a new directory and give it the name myfirstpost. Within it create an index.md file – your article and place a featured.jpg or .png for in the same directory as the thumbnail for the article. Use the example below to get started. The first lines in the file are the Front Matter, which tell Hugo what the look and experience of the article will be – different themes support different params for this. Check the docs for more info.\n--- title: \u0026#34;My first post\u0026#34; date: 2023-08-14 draft: false summary: \u0026#34;This is my first post on my site\u0026#34; tags: [\u0026#34;space\u0026#34;] --- ## A sub-title Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Aliquam sit amet nunc vulputate, facilisis neque in, faucibus nisl. You can create additional articles to see what your site will look like once there is content in it. Your site should look like the images below. The main page shows the recent articles, each article is connected through others automatically via related section, you have tag aggregation, and full-text search.\nShip it #\rThe only thing missing is to ship your site. I will be using Firebase for hosting - it’s a free alternative and provides more advanced features if you are creating something more complex. Go to firebase and create a new project. Once that is done, let’s switch to the CLI as it will make it easier to configure everything.\nLet’s install firebase’s CLI - if not on Mac check install instructions on Firebase.\nbrew install firebase Now log in and init firebase hosting for the project.\nfirebase login firebase init Select hosting and proceed.\nFollow the image below for the options I recommend. Make sure to set up the workflow files for GitHub actions. These will guarantee that your code will be deployed once there is a change to the repo.\nHowever, those files will not work out-of-box, as Hugo requires extra steps for the build to work. Please copy and paste the code blocks below to the respective files within the .github folder, but keep the original projectId in the files generated by firebase.\nfirebase-hosting-merge.yml #\r# This file was auto-generated by the Firebase CLI # https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools name: Deploy to Firebase Hosting on merge \u0026#39;on\u0026#39;: push: branches: - main jobs: build_and_deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Hugo setup uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2.6.0 env: ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS: \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; - name: Check out code into the Go module directory uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive) fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod - name: Build with Hugo env: # For maximum backward compatibility with Hugo modules HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production HUGO_ENV: production run: hugo -E -F --minify -d public - name: Deploy Production uses: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0 with: repoToken: \u0026#39;${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\u0026#39; firebaseServiceAccount: \u0026#39;${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BLOWFISH_TUTORIAL }}\u0026#39; channelId: live projectId: blowfish-tutorial firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml #\r# This file was auto-generated by the Firebase CLI # https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools name: Deploy to Firebase Hosting on PR \u0026#39;on\u0026#39;: pull_request jobs: build_and_preview: if: \u0026#39;${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository }}\u0026#39; runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Hugo setup uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2.6.0 env: ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS: \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; - name: Check out code into the Go module directory uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive) fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod - name: Build with Hugo env: # For maximum backward compatibility with Hugo modules HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production HUGO_ENV: production run: hugo -E -F --minify -d public - name: Deploy preview uses: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0 with: repoToken: \u0026#39;${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\u0026#39; firebaseServiceAccount: \u0026#39;${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BLOWFISH_TUTORIAL }}\u0026#39; expires: 30d channelId: preview-${{ github.event.number }} projectId: blowfish-tutorial The last step is committing your code to GitHub and let the workflows you created take care of deploying your site. Since we configured GitHub actions, this will trigger a job that will configure and deploy your site automatically.\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026#34;add github actions workflows\u0026#34; git push If the actions tab for your repo, you should see something like this.\nOnce all the steps finish, your Firebase console should show something like the image below - including the links to see your app – I got a version of this tutorial running on https://blowfish-tutorial.web.app/.\nConclusion and Next Steps #\rNow you have your first version of your homepage. You can make changes locally and once you commit your code they will automatically be reflected online. What shall you do next?
