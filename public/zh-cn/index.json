._* .Spotlight-V100 .Trashes # Hugo public 最后一步是保存所有更改，并推送到你的远程仓库中。 The last step is to save all the changes to the repo.\ngit add . git commit -m “initial commit” git push 创建并配置站点 #\r所有的准备工作就绪后，创建和配置你的站点将会很容易。继续在上一部分你创建的文件夹内，让我们首先创建一个空的 Hugo 网站（不关联任何主题）。\nhugo new site --force . 执行完成后，尝试用下面的命令来运行你的网站。打开浏览器并访问 https://localhost:1313 即可查看你的网站。\nhugo server emmmm… 页面未找到404了，是吧？ 这是预期内的，你创建了一个空白网站，Hugo 不会添加任何默认的页面——换句话说，你的网站还没有任何页面可以显示。\n下一步，让我门使用 git submodules 来安装 Blowfish。通过 git submodules 安装可以让以后管理和升级 Blowfish 主题更加方便。\ngit submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish 接下来，在你的代码根目录下创建 config/_default/ 文件夹。现在你需要下载\r这些文件，并把它们放在刚刚创建的 _default 文件夹内。最终的文件结构看起来应该是这样的。\nconfig/_default/ ├─ config.toml ├─ languages.en.toml ├─ markup.toml ├─ menus.en.toml └─ params.toml ` 打开 config.toml 并把 theme = \u0026ldquo;blowfish” 这一样的注释取消掉，目前为止你已经准备好了。再次尝试运行网站，并打开浏览器在_\rhttps://localhost:1313_查看效果。\nhugo server 你应该能看到下面这样。目前我们还没有添加任何内容，所以还没有页面，但是 Blowfish 主题已经准备就绪，下面只需要配置。\n现在我们来配置主题。\n仅供参考 本指南不会详细介绍 Blowfish 中的所有特性和参数——如果想要了解所有的功能特性和参数，以及如何使用它们，请参考\rBlowfish 文档。\rmenus.en.toml #\r这个文件定义了你的顶部（banner）和底部（footer）的菜单结构。对于本指南，我们只使用菜单的这两部分：Posts 和 Tags。\nPosts - 用于展示网站中的所有内容条目的完整列表 Tags - 自动生成每篇文章的标签 为了实现这一点，请确保 menus.en.toml 文件中设置了以下参数。完成修改后，重新运行hugo server，你将会看到顶部菜单。\n[[main]] name = \u0026#34;Posts\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;posts\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;Tags\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; weight = 30 languages.en.toml #\r这个文件配置了网站作者的详细信息。修改下面的内容来定义你自己的信息。\n[author] name = \u0026#34;名字在这\u0026#34; image = \u0026#34;profile.jpg\u0026#34; headline = \u0026#34;我是个好人\u0026#34; bio = \u0026#34;关于我的二三事\u0026#34; # 出现在每篇文章的作者卡片中 网站的图片需要防止在 assets 文件夹内。针对这一步，请将一张你的个人图片添加到这个文件夹，并命名为 profile.jpg。 你可以修改这个文件名，确保文件名和上面个人信息中 image 的参数值对应就行。如果你没有个人图片可用，你可以使用下面的图片继续教程。\nassets/profile.jpg\r最后一步是配置你的链接——社交媒体、GitHub 等等。该文件包含了所有支持的链接选项，不过他们被注释掉了。你可以将你希望展示的个人链接的配置项接触注释，也可以替换他们的展示顺序。\nparams.toml #\r这个文件是 Blowfish 的配置文件。大部分的视觉选项或自定义的选项可以通过它进行配置，它涵盖了 Blowfish 主题的多个功能特性。 对于本指南，我决定使用 background 布局，你也可以\r查看Blowfish主题其他的主页布局；同时使用了 Neon 颜色方案，你可以查看\r完整的颜色方案列表或者\r创建自己的颜色方案。\n将 image.jpg 文件添加到 assets 文件夹，它将会作为网站的背景。你可以挑选自己喜欢的，当然也可以用本指南中使用的这张图。\nassets/image.jpg\r现在让我们打开 params.toml 并开始配置。在这里我只会关注需要修改的值，不要再没看文档的情况下，删除此文件的其余部分。\n首先让我们确保上面提到的正确的颜色方案，开启图片优化，并设置默认背景图片。\ncolorScheme = \u0026#34;neon\u0026#34; disableImageOptimization = false defaultBackgroundImage = \u0026#34;image.jpg\u0026#34; # used as default for background images 接下来，让我们配置首页。我们选择了 background 布局，配置首页图片和最近文章。此外，可以使用 card view 卡片展示的方式来展现最新文章。最后让我们配置头部固定。\n[homepage] layout = \u0026#34;background\u0026#34; # valid options: page, profile, hero, card, background, custom homepageImage = \u0026#34;image.jpg\u0026#34; # used in: hero, and card showRecent = true showRecentItems = 6 showMoreLink = true showMoreLinkDest = \u0026#34;/posts\u0026#34; cardView = true cardViewScreenWidth = false layoutBackgroundBlur = true # only used when layout equals background [header] layout = \u0026#34;fixed\u0026#34; 现在配置文章和列表页面的展示。下面是他们的配置。\n[article] showHero = true heroStyle = \u0026#34;background\u0026#34; showSummary = true showTableOfContents = true showRelatedContent = true relatedContentLimit = 3 [list] showCards = true groupByYear = false cardView = true 如果你再次运行hugo server，你会看到类似下面这张图的效果。 If you run hugo server again, you should see something like the image below.\n在你的网站中添加内容 #\r创建一个文件夹/content/posts，在这个文件夹下添加你的帖子或文章。这也是你在菜单所配置的所有文章的根目录。在这个文件夹内，让我们创建一个新目录并命名为 myfirstpost。在这个目录中创建一个index.md文件作为你的文章，同样也在这个目录中添加featured.jpg或featured.png作为文章的缩略图。 参考下面这个示例。文件中的前几行是扉页参数（Front Matter），它定义了 Hugo 如何展示文章，更多的参数可以参考\r这里。\n--- title: \u0026#34;我的第一篇帖子\u0026#34; date: 2023-08-14 draft: false summary: \u0026#34;这是网站的第一篇你帖子\u0026#34; tags: [\u0026#34;space\u0026#34;] --- ## 一个副标题 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Morbi nibh nisl, vulputate eu lacus vitae, maximus molestie libero. Vestibulum laoreet, odio et sollicitudin sollicitudin, quam ligula tempus urna, sed sagittis eros eros ac felis.
